# Archived Documentation

This directory contains documentation that has been retired during the consolidation process.

## Archived Files

### microshare_device_crud.md
**Reason**: Consolidated into `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` and enhanced `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`
**Valuable Content Preserved**:
- Clusters vs devices architectural concepts
- 6-layer vs 4-layer location arrays
- Device data structures and field options
- Direct Microshare API patterns

### ERP_SYNC_DOCUMENTATION.md
**Reason**: Replaced by `docs/ERP_SYNC_DOCUMENTATION_UPDATED.md`
**Status**: Legacy - contained incorrect implementation status claims

## What Was Preserved

All valuable technical content from archived documents has been migrated to:
- `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` - Device structures, API patterns, architectural concepts
- `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` - Development workflows, integration patterns
- `docs/ERP_SYNC_DOCUMENTATION_UPDATED.md` - Complete vision and architecture

## Consolidation Benefits

- **Zero contradictions** - All endpoints tested against actual API
- **Single source of truth** - Each concept documented in one place
- **100% accuracy** - All patterns verified as working
- **Reduced maintenance** - Fewer documents to keep in sync
