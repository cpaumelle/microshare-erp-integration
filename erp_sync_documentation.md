## Microshare x ERP Integration for Pest Control Management

**Document Version**: 2.0  
**Implementation Status**: Phase 1 Discovery Operational  
**Target Audience**: ERP Developers, System Integrators, IoT Architects

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a bidirectional synchronization system between traditional ERP business processes (we used the open source Odoo for our example) and modern IoT device management (Microshare) for pest control operations. The implementation bridges the gap between business-centric inspection scheduling and real-time sensor monitoring.

### Data Flow Architecture

**ERP → Sync Bridge → IoT Platform**

1. **ERP Discovery**: Read pest control inspection points from Odoo `product.product` table
2. **Location Parsing**: Extract customer/site/area from ERP naming conventions
3. **Reference Matching**: Map ERP codes to Microshare device location[3] field
4. **Gap Analysis**: Identify unmapped inspection points requiring IoT devices
5. **Device Recommendations**: Generate Microshare device templates with default DevEUI

### Current Capabilities

#### 1. ERP Data Discovery
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/erp/discovery/inspection-points`
- **Function**: Retrieves all pest control inspection points from Odoo
- **Data Volume**: 11 inspection points across Golden Crust Manchester
- **Performance**: Real-time XML-RPC connection to Odoo

#### 2. Mapping Analysis  
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/erp/discovery/unmapped`
- **Function**: Identifies ERP points without corresponding IoT devices
- **Current Result**: 9 unmapped points requiring device creation
- **Recommendation**: Create devices with DevEUI `00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00`

#### 3. Location Hierarchy Translation
- **ERP Format**: "Golden Crust Manchester - Flour Storage Silo A"
- **IoT Format**: `["Golden Crust Manchester", "Manchester Production", "Flour Storage Silo A", "ERP024_025_01", "Internal", "Bait/Lured"]`
- **Matching Key**: ERP `default_code` ↔ Microshare `location[3]`

### Data Structure Mapping

#### Odoo ERP Side
```jsonc
{
  "model": "product.product",  
  "category_filter": "categ_id = 4",
  "fields": {
    "id": "Unique Odoo record ID (1-11+)",
    "default_code": "ERP reference (ERP024_025_01)",    // This is the unique reference used by the ERP for the inspection point
    "barcode": "DevEUI storage field",                  // This is the Microshare unique device ID which can be synched back to the ERP
    "name": "Location description",                     // This is the location array descibing the customer, building, floor, room, etc
    "active": "Inspection point status"                 // This may be used to record whether an inspection point is equipped with a sensor or not
  }
}
```

#### Microshare IoT Side
```jsonc
{
  "device_structure": {
    "id": "DevEUI or default 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00",
    "meta": {
      "location": [
        "Customer name",      // [0] Maps to parsed ERP location
        "Site name",         // [1] Standardized site naming  
        "Area name",         // [2] From ERP inspection point
        "ERP reference",     // [3] PRIMARY MATCHING KEY
        "Placement",         // [4] Internal/External
        "Configuration"      // [5] Bait/Lured/etc
      ]
    },
    "status": "pending|active|inactive"
  }
}
```

### Current Limitations

1. **Read-Only Discovery**: No device creation or modification operations
2. **Limited Error Handling**: Mapping endpoint occasionally times out under load
3. **Static Location Parsing**: Customer/site naming hardcoded to Golden Crust Manchester
4. **No Incident Correlation**: Cannot correlate sensor events with ERP service records
5. **Manual DevEUI Assignment**: Default DevEUI requires manual deployment processes
